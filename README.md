README 

A short slidedeck prepared for a workshop in Jakarta in September 2014, looking at different types of data visualisations. Examples are taken from various aid data websites, looking specifically at how data around Official Development Assistance in Indonesia can be visualised. 

Slides are forked from [Michael's presentation for School of Data](https://github.com/school-of-data/Introduction-to-dataviz) and slides for that area based on these [html5slides](https://code.google.com/p/html5slides/).
